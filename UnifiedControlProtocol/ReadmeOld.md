    #Unified Control Protocol
    The e:cue Lighting Application suite allows for flexble integration with external systems. While the integration options are powerful and flexible, they are not always intuitive or consistent. Such is the case with the RS232 and UDP protocol options. 

    In standalone mode, the Butler XT2 provides an fairly intuitive RS232 protocol that is easy to integrate with a variety of 3rd-party systems. Programmer's default RS232 protocol is less flexible and requires more work to implement while UDP integration must be implemented from scratch in scripting. 

    This script seeks to emulate the Butler XT2 RS232 protocol in Programmer's online mode as well as providing the same protocol for use over UDP in the same script, allowing for a consistent integration workflow across technologies. 

    ##Configuration
    In order to integrate the script into your show file, you'll need to do the following
